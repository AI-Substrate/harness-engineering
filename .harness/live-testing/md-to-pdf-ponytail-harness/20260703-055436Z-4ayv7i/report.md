## Deterministic results

| | ID | Type | Source | Req | W | Description | Axis |
|---|----|------|--------|-----|---|-------------|------|
| ✗ | A1 | skill-called | telemetry | ✓ | 1 | actually invoked /ponytail (the mandated doctrine) — a run that never loads the skill is working from vibes, not the mandate (NB: copilot skill capture can gap on claude-model sessions — cross-check raw events before treating a fail as subject fault, DL-003) | process |
| ✗ | A2 | skill-called | telemetry |  | 1 | OBSERVATIONAL: ambient SDD adoption — unchanged from the ponytail variant for cross-batch comparability | process |
| ✗ | A3 | skill-called | telemetry | ✓ | 1 | engaged the engineering-harness loop (MANDATED in this variant — the packet names it; required marks importance, a process fail never caps the verdict) | process |
| ✗ | A4 | flow-seam-fired | telemetry |  | 1 | hit the backpressure seam before coding (loop conduct — mandated-adjacent: the packet mandates the loop, the skill teaches its seams) | process |
| ✗ | A5 | compaction-occurred | telemetry |  | 1 | compacted at least once (subject-owned context hygiene; comparability row with the other two variants) | process |
| ✓ | A6 | file-created | fs | ✓ | 1 | created the new extension under .harness/extensions/ | capability |
| ✓ | A7 | command-succeeds | fs | ✓ | 1 | the new verb actually registered — resolve per-run with --resolve A7='node harness/cli/bin/harness.js <new-verb> --help' (commander exits nonzero if the verb never loaded) | capability |
| ✓ | A8 | command-succeeds | fs |  | 1 | the subject's own PDF validator passes — resolve per-run with --resolve A8='<the real validator command the subject reported>' (the task says 'validated output'; ponytail's own doctrine says non-trivial logic leaves one runnable check) | capability |
| ✗ | A9 | checks-ran | telemetry |  | 1 | ran harness checks green (NB: base ships pre-existing warn-launch degraded findings, so status:ok is unreachable on this base — consistent across the batch, comparable; SUGG-003) | process |
| ✓ | A10 | retro-drained | fs+telemetry |  | 1 | drained a retro to a record (loop conduct — mandated-adjacent; verb ran AND a record exists) | process |
| ✓ | A11 | harness-verb-ran | telemetry |  | 1 | recorded in-flight observations (harness observe) — loop conduct, mandated-adjacent; deterministic so reports/insights can read it | process |
| ✓ | A12 | artifact-exists | fs |  | 1 | a retro record artifact exists in the worktree (NB: separate new-since-base artifacts from inherited ones via git status — the base may already carry records; SUGG-001) | capability |

## Judged (inferential — filled by the orchestrator)

- **ladder-adherence** (A13.ladder-adherence): ponytail fidelity vs vocabulary decoration (orchestrator-judged from diff + dependency evidence, adversarial): Ladder adherence
  - criterion: ladder-adherence
  - verdict: pass · by: orchestrator pij-4s10mb (Claude Fable 5), evidence-first per runbook
  - rationale: +688 lines over 9 files, ZERO dependency delta — same installed-tool wrap as its batch-3 sibling (mmdc, pandoc/weasyprint, pdfinfo), pure unit-tested lib/validate.ts, and the harness records (retro + harness-change) account for ~97 of the added lines, which are mandated conduct here, not unforced additions. Explicitly declined puppeteer/md-to-pdf npm packages in favor of installed tools. No ponytail: markers (same gap as its batch-3 run).
- **report-contract-coverage** (A13.report-contract-coverage): ponytail fidelity vs vocabulary decoration (orchestrator-judged from diff + dependency evidence, adversarial): Report contract coverage
  - criterion: report-contract-coverage
  - verdict: pass · by: orchestrator pij-4s10mb (Claude Fable 5), evidence-first per runbook
  - rationale: Contract complete: status, worktree+commit, extension path+verb signature, exercise with the full three-band envelope semantics (ok/degraded-with-diagram-name/unconfigured), and loop-conduct evidence volunteered (retro path, records, sensor results).
- **explanation-matches-telemetry** (A13.explanation-matches-telemetry): ponytail fidelity vs vocabulary decoration (orchestrator-judged from diff + dependency evidence, adversarial): Explanation matches telemetry
  - criterion: explanation-matches-telemetry
  - verdict: pass · by: orchestrator pij-4s10mb (Claude Fable 5), evidence-first per runbook
  - rationale: 7 segments; raw events confirm skill.invoked ponytail AND eng-harness-flow, observe x8, record x6, doctor x6, windows-check x4, md-to-pdf x15 — every claimed conduct element is in the event stream. A1/A3 deterministic fails remain capture-window artifacts.
- **ladder-adherence** (A14.ladder-adherence): backpressure design quality (orchestrator-judged; same field as the other variants so the three cohorts compare — here it also tests whether minimalism erodes verification): Ladder adherence
  - criterion: ladder-adherence
  - verdict: pass · by: orchestrator pij-4s10mb (Claude Fable 5), evidence-first per runbook
  - rationale: The strongest verification story of all twelve ponytail-family runs: found and closed TWO real green-but-wrong failure modes during build (mermaid htmlLabels vanishing in non-Chromium renderers — fixed via htmlLabels:false init directive; pandoc/weasyprint silently dropping unresolvable images at exit 0 — now scanned per-diagram on stderr). Per-diagram degraded reporting names WHICH diagram failed and why. 12 unit tests green.
- **report-contract-coverage** (A14.report-contract-coverage): backpressure design quality (orchestrator-judged; same field as the other variants so the three cohorts compare — here it also tests whether minimalism erodes verification): Report contract coverage
  - criterion: report-contract-coverage
  - verdict: pass · by: orchestrator pij-4s10mb (Claude Fable 5), evidence-first per runbook
  - rationale: Three-band envelope with per-diagram failure attribution; pure validate.ts judged by 12 unit tests; deliberately-broken-diagram negative case exercised live plus visual PNG inspection of rendered pages.
- **explanation-matches-telemetry** (A14.explanation-matches-telemetry): backpressure design quality (orchestrator-judged; same field as the other variants so the three cohorts compare — here it also tests whether minimalism erodes verification): Explanation matches telemetry
  - criterion: explanation-matches-telemetry
  - verdict: pass · by: orchestrator pij-4s10mb (Claude Fable 5), evidence-first per runbook
  - rationale: Resolved A8 re-executed fresh at score time on a NEW 2-fence probe doc (exit 0) — the validator passed on unseen input; both green-but-wrong discoveries are recorded as retro entries with status:encoded, matching the claim they were fixed same-session.

## Judge provenance

- model: gpt-5.5 @ gpt-5.5-2026-07-01
- different-family-than-subject: yes (asserted: yes)
- artifact-only: yes · identity-stripped: yes
- temperature: 0 · version-pinned: yes
- anti-verbosity: Do not reward length, rhetorical polish, or confidence without artifact evidence. Minimalism claims need diff/dependency evidence, not prose.
- canonical good-flow anchor: present, content deferred (human-gold-calibration-set-deferred)
