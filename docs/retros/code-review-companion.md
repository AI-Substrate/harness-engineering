- summary: Reviewed the Phase 1 harness CLI work across per-commit pings and the final range sweep. I sent two HIGH findings around output-contract fidelity, both were fixed in dac64fa and re-verified; the final range d9f6435 passed with no open findings.
- **magicWand** (target: minih): Expose one canonical merged report template in `minih check --template <slug>` so agents can write exactly the schema that will be validated without reconciling multiple prompt examples.
- difficulties:
  - [annoying] config: The run instructions included a schema-shaped example that differed from the installed output-schema.json required by minih validation. (workaround: Read agents/code-review-companion/output-schema.json and wrote a combined report containing the schema-required session/findings fields plus the broader retrospective fields.)
  - [annoying] coordination: Finding traceability drifted slightly when the outside execution log collapsed two distinct inbox findings (F001 and F002) into F001a/F001b. (workaround: Kept the exact original finding IDs and ackOf values in this farewell envelope.)

- summary: Reviewed the Phase 2 harness CLI commit stream T001→final drain. Six code/contract findings raised + verified fixed inline (F001 detached-HEAD git smoke, F002 tri-state JSON injection, F003 run-dispatcher contract, F004 stale dry-run wording, F005 npm/npx symlink bin execution, F006 process.exit confinement); a seventh final-drain finding (F007) flagged tracked documentation drift (makeOutputPort → CliIo) and was resolved in docs.
- **workedWell**: Per-commit review pings gave small, reviewable scopes and let contract drift be caught while fixes were cheap.
- **magicWand** (target: coordination): Queued lifecycle controls should interrupt or visibly preempt final-drain reporting, so a companion does not emit new findings after the operator has already requested stop.
- **confusing**: The stop control was queued before the final-drain response was visible after compaction, creating an ordering ambiguity around F007.
- difficulties:
  - [coordination] Exact correlation metadata and cumulative finding state were harder to preserve across a long session plus compaction; generated plan docs also lagged behind contract-changing fixes.
- **improvementSuggestions**: Add a final-docs drift checklist to the outside closeout flow, and surface pending control messages prominently before companions send final-drain findings.

### Orchestrator retro (Phase 2)

- **OH-201 [gift]**: The companion caught two contract-defining issues a flat read would have missed — F003 (workshop 001's `run <slot>` dispatcher vs my flat-slot model) and F005 (the `isMain` guard silently breaking the npx bin symlink, the package's whole point). Both were cheap to fix at commit time, expensive later.
- **OH-202 [difficulty]**: Workshop skeletons that predate a kernel fix are a recurring drift trap — the dossier's `makeOutputPort` + `formatOk({status})` came straight from workshop 002 and both were superseded by Phase 1's F002 fix. Pre-surfacing the drift in the dossier helped, but the F002 redesign still removed `makeOutputPort` mid-build, leaving doc drift (F007).
- **OH-203 [improvement-suggestion]**: When a build deviates from the dossier (run-dispatcher split, CliIo), update the dossier's forward-looking lines in the same commit as the code change, not at phase end — would have pre-empted F007.
